No OPENAI_API_KEY set. Use Cursor (or any AI editor) to complete the naming step:

1. Open this prompt file in your editor:
   /Users/chetan/Documents/propage/whiiminds.com/rename-prompt.md

2. Paste the entire content into Cursor (or your AI assistant) and ask it to generate the JSON mapping.

3. Save the assistant's JSON response to a file in this folder, e.g.:
   /Users/chetan/Documents/propage/whiiminds.com/rename-mapping.json

4. Apply the renames by running (from the propage directory):
   python scripts/rename_with_ai.py whiiminds.com --apply-mapping whiiminds.com/rename-mapping.json

Optional: set OPENAI_API_KEY to skip this and use the API automatically.
